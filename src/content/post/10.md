title: The Pose of Progress
---
Yoga is ancient. AI is new. Two worlds you wouldn’t think to combine.

We just came across something fascinating: a dataset featuring 90 yoga poses, organized into levels of complexity, complete with 3D skeletons and videos. This isn’t just research—it could be a tool to enhance human movement.

Imagine having an AI yoga coach that provides real-time, personalized feedback to enhance your poses and progress—making your practice more effective and tailored just for you.

Curious? So are we. What could this mean for how we move and learn?
