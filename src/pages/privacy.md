Welcome to AbsIn5 (“AbsIn5”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). AbsIn5 provides a platform for on-demand fitness and health coaching services (“Services”). In order to provide our Site and Services (collectively, “Platform”), we collect personal data from our customers (“Customers”). We also host the personal data of our Customer’s end users (“End Users”) where our Customers’ data is hosted by AbsIn5.

This application, AbsIn5, requests access to Google user accounts to enhance user experience by personalizing content based on user preferences. We request only the necessary permissions to offer our services effectively. Permissions are requested contextually to ensure user understanding. We commit to maintaining the confidentiality of the information obtained from Google.

Throughout this Privacy Policy, “personal information” or “personal data” refers to any information that is unique to an individual, such as name, address, email address, phone number, IP address, and other information that can reasonably identify an individual.

This Privacy Policy, along with our Cookie Policy, covers how we collect, handle, and disclose personal data on our Platform, including any affiliated websites, software, or platforms owned or operated by AbsIn5 on which this Privacy Policy appears. Even though we store End Users’ personal data, it does not cover how or why our Customers may collect, handle, and disclose their End Users’ personal data when they visit or use their websites or platforms.

If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), this entire Privacy Policy applies to you. However, please see the section titled “Additional Information for Users in the EEA and the U.K.”, which will provide more detailed information about which rights you have regarding the processing of your personal data.

We recommend that you read this Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy carefully as both provide important information about your personal information and your rights under the law.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, our Cookie Policy, and/or our data practices, or would like to exercise your rights, do not hesitate to contact us.

For users in the EEA and the U.K., note that we may collect your personal data as a ‘data controller’ when we determine the means and purpose of processing, such as when we process the personal data of our Site Visitors, Event Attendees, and/or Customers, or as a ‘data processor’ when we collect and process personal data on behalf of our Customers who use our Services and host their data with AbsIn5. This is further explained below.

To Whom Does This Policy Apply

Note at the outset that this Privacy Policy does not cover our Customers’ websites. Each Customer is responsible for posting its own terms, conditions, and privacy policies, and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

This Privacy Policy applies to:

	•	Customers: This includes any individual who registers individually or on behalf of an entity or organization in order to use the Services.
	•	Site Visitors: Visitors to our Site, including those who may also opt-in to receive commercial communications from AbsIn5. This does not include any visitors to our Customers’ individual websites.
	•	Event Attendees: AbsIn5 may host and/or sponsor events and collect personal information from individuals when they attend (or register to attend) such events.
	•	End Users: AbsIn5 may process End User data on behalf of its Customers. While our Customers are responsible, as data controllers, for how and why they collect and process their End Users’ personal data, this Privacy Policy also applies to any End User personal information that we process, as a data processor, in order to provide Services to our Customers.

Children’s Privacy

AbsIn5 does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16. If you are under the age of 16, please do not submit any personal data through the Platform. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal data on our Platform without their permission.

If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 16 has provided personal data to AbsIn5 through the Platform, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated below, but we suggest that you review it from time to time, as our Platform and our business may change. As a result, at times it may be necessary for AbsIn5 to make changes to this Privacy Policy (and/or our Cookie Policy). AbsIn5 reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy and/or our Cookie Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. However, if we make changes that we believe will materially impact this Privacy Policy, the Cookie Policy, or your rights, we will promptly notify you of those changes. Your continued use of the Platform after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.

What Information Do We Collect

What personal information we collect and process depends on how and why you use our Platform. Generally, we process personal information that we receive:

	•	Directly from you when you provide it to us, such as in connection with our Services or Event registrations.
	•	Indirectly, through automated technologies such as cookies, or from third parties.
	•	On behalf of our Customers, when we process the personal data of their End Users as part of our Services.

This is all explained in more detail below.

Information We Collect Directly From You

You can generally visit our Site without having to submit any personal information. If you request more information, or sign up for our Services, we will collect personal information as follows.

Account Information: When you register for an AbsIn5 customer account (including when you join for free), we request your email address. Once your email has been confirmed by our systems and you have successfully signed up, we will ask you to create a username and optionally upload a profile picture. We also provide you the option of submitting your name, company name, and location. This information is your “Account Information” for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. Account Information is required to identify you as a Customer and permit you to access your account(s). By voluntarily providing us with such Account Information, you represent that you are the owner of such personal data or otherwise have the requisite consent to provide it to us.

Customer Payment Information: You are not required to enter your credit card information unless and until you decide to continue with a paid subscription to our Services. When you sign up for one of our paid Services, you must provide billing information. The information you will need to submit depends on which billing method you choose. In order to process your payment Information, we use PCI-compliant third-party processors, as explained in the Section on “Payment Processing” below. This information is processed by our payment service provider and we receive a confirmation of payment, which we then associate with your Account Information and any relevant transactions.

Event Attendee Information: We may collect personal information such as name, address, phone number, and email address when participants register for or attend a sponsored Event or other events at which AbsIn5 (and/or its affiliates or representatives) may be present. What information is collected depends on the Event, but any personal information that AbsIn5 receives in connection with an Event is processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Optional Information: We may also ask you to submit personal information if you choose to use interactive features of the Platform, including participation in surveys, promotions, requesting customer support, or otherwise communicating with us.

Information We Collect Indirectly

Device and Usage Information: When you download, use, or interact with the Site, even if you do not have an account, we, or authorized third parties engaged by us, may automatically collect information about your use of the Site via your device, some of which is considered personal information. “Device and Usage Information” that we collect consists of:

	•	Information About your Device: Information about the devices and software you use to access the Site — primarily the internet browser or mobile device that you use, the website or source that linked or referred you to the Site, your IP address or device ID (or other persistent identifier that uniquely identifies your computer or mobile device on the Internet), the operating system of your computer or mobile device, device screen size, and other similar technical information.
	•	Usage Information: Information about your interactions with the Platform, including access dates and times, hardware and software information, device event information, log data, crash data, cookie data. This information allows us to understand the screens that you view, how you’ve used the Platform (which may include administrative and support communications with us), and other actions on the Platform. We, or authorized third parties, automatically collect log data when you access and use the Platform, even if you have not created an account or logged in. We use this information to administer and improve the Services, analyze trends, track users’ use of the Platform, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

Based on Device and Usage Information, we are also able to determine general location information (“Location Information”).
